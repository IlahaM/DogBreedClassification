# DogBreedClassification

## Libraries used
Numpy
OpenCV
Matplotlib
ResNet50 
InceptionV3 etc.

## Motivation for the project 
The aim of the project is to determine the breed of the dog using CNN when provided with a user-supplied dog image. 
If a human is detected in the image, it identifies the breed that he/she is most resembling.

## Files in the repository 
dog_app.ipny â€“ notebook file containing the main code used to detect the breed of the dog

## Summary of the results of the analysis 
Different pre-trained CNN models are used to detect the dog breeds. The last tested model has the accuracy of 78.5%.
